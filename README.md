# Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference
# ACT_SAT_Comparison

### Overview

We're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams. Your presentation should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams.

### Methods

- Describe the data
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to explore distributions of individual variables and relationships among pairs of variables
- Display your cleaned Jupyter notebook on a personal static website.
 - Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Seaborn!
 - Use Tableau Public to create visualizations!
 - Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) describing your data, analysis, and approach. Link to it in your Jupyter notebook.
 - Using existing features, engineer new features

While there are very specific requests in the starter code, these are only requirements, not restrictions. Feel free to do more EDA, feature engineering, visualization, etc. than what is requested.

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Materials must be submitted in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook.
- Notebook must be submitted via pushing to your remote repo.
- Presentation must be submitted via Slack (for a PowerPoint file) or shared via a Google Form.
- Your notebook and presentation slides must be additionally hosted on your personal static site.
- **Materials must be submitted by 10:00 AM on Friday, August 10th.**

### Starter code

For this project we will be using a Jupyter notebook. This notebook will use matplotlib for plotting and visualizing our data. This type of visualization is handy for prototyping and quick data analysis. We will discuss more advanced data visualizations for communicating your work.

Open the [starter code instructions](./code/) in a Jupyter notebook.

### Dataset

For this project, you'll be using two datasets:

- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat.csv)
- [Dataset: ACT Scores](./data/act.csv)

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.
